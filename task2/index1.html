  <p>
    A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are
    words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but
    not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.

    Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the
    body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create
    thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just
    written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.

  <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
  <hr>
  <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
  <b style=" font-size: 200%;">header size</b>
  <br>
  <p>and <span style="color: blue;">color</span> <span style="color: red;">of</span> <span
      style="color: aqua;">letters</span> seen on the screen. The <span style="font-size: 200%;">font size</span>
    can be changed as well,
    and actually <mark>gives</mark> more
    choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.

    Now is the <i>time</i> for all good <strong>people</strong> to <strong>come</strong> to the
    <em>aid</em> of their country.
    That was also an example of a nested command.
